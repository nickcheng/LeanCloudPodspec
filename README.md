# LeanCloudPodspec

Podspec for LeanCloud

## How to use and why

If you have met problems using AVOSCloud (LeanCloud) v3.1.2.6 pod with CocoaPods 0.38 in XCode 7 beta (beta 3 for me), please follow the steps below to solve:

1. Clone this project in your folder
2. In your podfile: `pod 'AVOSCloud', :path => '~/path/to/folder'`. For me, it's: `pod 'AVOSCloud', :path => '~/Code/github/LeanCloudPodspec'`.
